					<h3>Assessment</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>The Psycho-Educational Assessment is performed in a comfortable, non-threatening environment. The welfare of the child is always the first priority.</p>
					<p>The assessment includes a feedback session with parents, students, and school personnel (if so desired); an involved and detailed report outlining results; a diagnosis (if necessary); and an array of specific recommendations. All of this is provided in a professional and expedient fashion.</p>
					<p>The cost is reasonable and most insurance policies cover a large portion of the fee.</p>

					<h3>Testimonials</h3>
					<hr>
					<h4>From the Parents</h4>

					<blockquote class="blockquote">“I can't thank you enough for all your help. You have been unbelievably supportive and responsive. I am so grateful. Thank you for meeting with my little Jamie yesterday. I really think it made a difference. He was so happy going to school afterwards. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! I hope some day I will be able to repay the kindness you have shown my children and myself. You really are special. Thank you again.”</blockquote>
					<blockquote class="blockquote">“Thank you so much Shawna. She enjoyed you as well! She said she had a lot of fun. Not a reaction that I expected! She also told me how you encouraged her. You really are so great – you definitely bring out the best in people and get rid of the "nerves" so beautifully.”</blockquote>
					<blockquote class="blockquote">“Just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for completing the report so quickly and again for the special care you showed in dealing with Emily. You made what could have been a difficult, stressful ordeal in to a pleasurable one for Emily and myself. You are professional and warm which is a wonderful combination. It was a pleasure working with you and I appreciate the open line for future help for Emily.”</blockquote>
					<blockquote class="blockquote">“Dear Shawna; Now that the kids are off to camp, I have some time to play catch up. I want to start by thanking you for taking the time to assess Jessica. I belive that your compassionate, kind nature together with your professional ability make you outstanding at what you do. You not only highlight and define the issues but provide solutions enabling everybody to feel optimistic and hopeful. Although there were no surprises I did feel badly re: the significance of the learning disability as I can anticipate some of her future challenges. That said, not knowing does not make it not so and at least now we can get on with the business of helping her with some of her challenges while focusing on her strengths.”</blockquote>

					<h4>From the School Board</h4>

					<blockquote class="blockquote"><p class="hov">“This year our school has had the privilege of working with a true professional, Shawna Citron, as our school psycho-educational consultant. The welfare of the student was first and foremost. During her parent meetings she was able to explain the lengthy assessment results so that they understood what was done, the results, the future, and answered any questions that arose. They left feeling informed and knew they were part of the school partnership. As a member of the school team, she was supportive of staff and helped to provide information and strategies to them in dealing with the students’ needs.” 
						<footer class="blockquote-footer">Principal, Toronto District School Board</footer></blockquote>
					<blockquote class="blockquote">“I have to say that I have seen many reports, but I do value yours. The info is pertinent, user-friendly and applicable for the classroom. You’re very good at what you do!”
						<footer class="blockquote-footer">Coordinator of the Centre for Diverse Learning, Associated Hebrew Schools</footer></blockquote>
					<blockquote class="blockquote">“Shawna demonstrates excellent ability on her assessments of students for the Toronto District School Board as well as providing feedback to parents and the school team in an articulate, thoughtful and considerate manner.”
						<footer class="blockquote-footer">Special Education Coordinator, Toronto District School Board</footer></blockquote>
					<blockquote class="blockquote">“Mrs. Citron was always caring in her assessment of the children. Ensuring that the process was a positive one for the students was of the utmost importance to her. The children genuinely enjoyed their time with Mrs. Citron and walked away from the experience feeling good about themselves. Mrs. Citron was able to produce a thorough report and completed it in an expedient fashion. Parents appreciated her professional manner and felt that the process was an informative and worthwhile one.” <footer class="blockquote-footer">Principal, USDS</footer></blockquote>
