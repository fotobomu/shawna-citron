			<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>
			<p>The Psycho-Educational Assessment is performed in a comfortable, non-threatening environment. The welfare of the child is always the first priority.</p>

			<p>The assessment includes a feedback session with parents, students, and school personnel (if so desired); an involved and detailed report outlining results; a diagnosis (if necessary); and an array of specific recommendations. All of this is provided in a professional and expedient fashion.</p>

			<p>The cost is reasonable and most insurance policies cover a large portion of the fee.</p>

			<h2 id="about">About Shawna</h2>
			<p>Shawna Citron has been providing Psycho-Educational Assessments for twenty-five years, with experience in a broad range of ages for students from diverse backgrounds.</p>

			<p>Shawna uses all of the up-to-date tests available including cognitive testing (IQ); memory testing; an evaluation of various information processing skills; and a full battery of academic tests (i.e., spelling, reading, comprehension, writing, numerical operation, and mathematical reasoning, etc.).</p>

			<p>A social-emotional component can also be added to gauge a variety of areas including: how the child feels about themselves; their academic functioning and their social standing.</p>

			<p>Depending on the presenting concern, a preliminary screening of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can be completed. Giftedness can also be diagnosed.</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>"This year our school has had the privilege of working with a true professional, Shawna Citron, as our school psycho-educational consultant. The welfare of the student was first and foremost. During her parent meetings she was able to explain the lengthy assessment results so that they understood what was done, the results, the future, and answered any questions that arose. They left feeling informed and knew they were part of the school partnership. As a member of the school team, she was supportive of staff and helped to provide information and strategies to them in dealing with the students’ needs."</p>
				<p><em>– Principal, Toronto District School Board</em></p>
			</blockquote>
			<blockquote>
				<p>"Mrs. Citron was always caring in her assessment of the children. Ensuring that the process was a positive one for the students was of the utmost importance to her. The children genuinely enjoyed their time with Mrs. Citron and walked away from the experience feeling good about themselves. Mrs. Citron was able to produce a thorough report and completed it in an expedient fashion. Parents appreciated her professional manner and felt that the process was an informative and worthwhile one."</p>
